# Welcome to Sagebrush Mesh

Welcome to the Sagebrush Mesh community website! Here you will find information to help you get your Meshtastic or MeshCore nodes setup and connected. 

## What is Sagebrush Mesh?

We're a community of Meshtastic users working together to build a robust mesh radio network across Eastern Washington. Whether you're in the Palouse hills, Yakima Valley, Columbia Basin, or up near the Canadian border, we're laying the groundwork for reliable off-grid communication — with coverage stretching into Oregon, Idaho, and even parts of British Columbia
